<h1 id="focusgroup">Guided Installation Option</h1>
<p>Help us improve CodeStream for first-time users by participating in a 20-minute zoom call: screen-share while we guide you along the way and demonstrate CodeStream's capabilities. If you work on a team with at least 10 developers <a href="https://app.hubspot.com/meetings/claudio13/a-codestream-specialist-supports-your-onboarding-live">please schedule a time here</a>.

<h1 id="pullrequest">Create and Review Pull Requests in your IDE</h1>
<p>Create, review and merge pull requests inside your IDE, with full source-tree and full file access, your favorite keybindings, built-in diff too, and code intelligence.</p>

<h1 id="codereview">Get Feedback on Work-in-Progress with Pre-PR Code Reviews</h1>
<p>CodeStream's lightweight feedback requests let you get feedback on your changes regardless of the current state of your repo, without the friction of committing, pushing or issuing a pull request. Your teammates can review your changes right in their IDE, with full file context, and with no need to set aside their current work to switch branches or pull the latest.</p>
<br/>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeamCodeStream/codestream-guide/develop/docs/src/assets/images/animated/FRPerform-JB.gif" alt="Review Changes" /></p>
<br/>
<p>CodeStream’s feedback requests are so easy that you can start doing them throughout the development process instead of waiting until the end. You’re a few days into a sprint and have some work stubbed out? Maybe some work that hasn’t even been committed. Get feedback on your work-in-progress so that you can identify and resolve issues early instead of saving those gotchas for when you need to get the code merged.</p>

<h1 id="discusscode">Simplified Code Discussion</h1>
<p>Rather than copying & pasting, CodeStream enables in-editor commenting on any code in your repository, with optional sharing to Slack, Teams or via email, with automatic at-mentioning of code authors via git blame.</p>
<br/>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeamCodeStream/codestream-guide/develop/docs/src/assets/images/animated/DiscussCode1-JB.gif" alt="Discuss Code" /></p>
<br/>
<p>Your teammates can participate in the discussion right from their IDE, or from Slack, Teams, or replying to the email.</p>
<br/>

<h1 id="knowledgebase">Build the Knowledge Base Behind Your Codebase</h1>
<p>CodeStream turns conversation into documentation by capturing all of the discussion about your code, and saving it with your code. Comment and code review threads are automatically repositioned as your code changes, even across branches. All with zero effort on your part.</p>
<br/>

<br/>
<p>Previously discussed questions and issues that explain important decisions are now accessible right where you need them, when you need them. Just click on the codemark to expand it and see how something works or why something was done a certain way.</p>

<h1 id="liveview">Team Transparency through Live View</h1>
<p>Development is a collaborative activity, yet much of it happens in isolation, with work only shared with the team at the end of a cycle, or sprint. CodeStream’s “LiveView” increases transparency by making the local edits of individual developers visible to team members, so that everyone knows what everyone else is working on, in real-time.</p>
<br/>
<p>As developers write code, whether editing existing files or creating new files, a summary of their changes, including the repo(s), files, and lines changed is exposed to their teammates through CodeStream. The information is displayed contextually, in the IDE, and even warns teammates of potential merge conflicts… before they happen!</p>
